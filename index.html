    <h1>Privacy Policy for Insight Forge Chrome Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Insert Date]</strong></p>
    <p>Insight Forge is a Chrome extension that helps you forge insights from digital content using AI. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our extension.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Insight Forge collects and stores the following types of user data locally in your browser:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API Key:</strong> Users provide their OpenAI API key to enable AI features. This key is stored securely in your browser’s local storage (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>) and is used only to authenticate with the OpenAI API. We do not share this key with any third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> Chat interactions, including selected text, prompts, and AI responses, are stored locally in your browser’s local storage (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>) to provide chat history functionality. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Data:</strong> Features like screenshot capture may temporarily store images locally before sending them to OpenAI for processing. This data is deleted after the process is complete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use your data solely to provide the extension’s functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The OpenAI API key authenticates with OpenAI’s services.</li>
        <li>Chat history enables you to review past interactions.</li>
        <li>Selected text and screenshots are sent to OpenAI’s API for processing, as requested by you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By installing and using Insight Forge, you consent to the collection and use of your data as outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All user data (API key, chat history, and temporary data) is stored locally in your browser. We do not send this data to external servers or third parties, except when you interact with the OpenAI API. During these interactions, your prompt, selected text, or screenshots, along with the API key, are securely transmitted to OpenAI, governed by their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and User Control</h2>
    <p>Your data remains in local storage until you delete it. You can clear your chat history and remove your API key anytime via the extension’s settings. We do not keep any copies of your data.</p>

    <h2>5. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data with third-party services or advertisers, except for the necessary interaction with OpenAI as described above.</p>
